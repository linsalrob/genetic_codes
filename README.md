# Genetic Codes

Python code for working with the NCBI Genetic Codes

The [NCBI Genetic Codes](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/Utils/wprintgc.cgi?chapter=tgencodes#SG1) are central to working with alternate genetic codes. This Python tool kit includes a library that exposes the genetic codes so you can query a codon and get its variants or query a code and get its table.
